## Lichess puzzle database <a name=database></a>

The Lichess puzzle database was downloaded from [https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles) on March 22, 2023. The data was in the form of a compressed `.csv` using [`zstd`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compression. This file was decompressed in command line and converted to a `pandas` dataframe using `.read_csv()`.

The data initially contained no headers, so we added headers in line with the [database documentation](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles).

Checking for missing or null values, we found quite a few in the `Opening_Tags` column.

This was to be expected, though—opening tags are only set for puzzles occuring before move `20` since a tactic occuring within the first `20` moves of a game likely has features strongly influenced by the opening played, whereas puzzles occuring later may not be as strongly influenced by the opening.

Finally, we added a column for `Puzzle_Length` that counts the number of moves in the puzzle from it's starting position. The first move in the `Moves` column sets up the position to present to the player, so `Puzzle_Length` is `1` less than the number of moves in `Moves`.

Note that the number of moves the *player* must make is actually half of the number of moves in the `Moves` column, or

>$$\dfrac{\text{Puzzle Length} + 1}{2}.$$

## My puzzle activity <a name=activity></a>

I used a personal token generated from https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token to access my puzzle activity from the Lichess API at https://lichess.org/api/puzzle/activity.

The response is a `.ndjson` file, i.e. a new-line delimited `json` file. I had trouble getting `pandas` to read this, so I first split the response text into a list, to which I applied `json.loads()` to parse each element as a `.json` object. Afterward, `.json_normalize()` was able to convert this list of `.json` objects into a dataframe.

Note that the `date` column is in `13`-digit format. I converted these to `datetime`.

## My puzzle rating history <a name=history></a>

My rating history was downloaded directly from https://lichess.org/api/user/tclark/rating-history as a `.json` file. My puzzle rating history was encoded as a list of points at index `13` of this file. This list was read into a dataframe as below.

The `month` column had `January` corresponding to `0`, which I found strange—so, I added `1` to each entry in `month`.
